What technologies are commonly used in Web Development 3.0?	Technologies like blockchain (Ethereum, Solana), smart contracts (Solidity, Rust), decentralized storage (IPFS, Arweave), and AI-powered tools are integral to Web Development 3.0.
How is AI transforming Web Development 3.0?	AI enhances automation, personalization, and decision-making in Web 3.0 by enabling smart recommendations, AI-powered chatbots, and automated web development tools.
What role do smart contracts play in Web Development 3.0?	Smart contracts automate transactions and agreements without intermediaries, making web interactions more secure, transparent, and efficient.
What is the significance of decentralized identity in Web 3.0?	Decentralized identity allows users to control their personal data and authentication without relying on centralized authorities, enhancing privacy and security.
What is an Initial Coin Offering (ICO)?	An ICO is a fundraising method where new cryptocurrencies are sold to investors before launch to raise capital for blockchain projects.
How does an ICO work?	Companies create a token, set a price, and investors buy it with cryptocurrency or fiat money, funding the project’s development.
Is investing in an ICO safe?	ICO investments carry risks. It's important to research the project, team, and whitepaper before investing.
How is an ICO different from an IPO?	Unlike IPOs, ICOs are typically unregulated and don’t grant ownership in a company, but offer tokens instead.
What are the benefits of participating in an ICO?	Early investors can acquire tokens at a lower price, which may appreciate in value as the project grows.
How do I participate in an ICO?	You need a cryptocurrency wallet that supports the project's token, funds in crypto (like ETH or BTC), and follow the ICO instructions.
What is an NFT Marketplace?	An NFT marketplace is an online platform where users can buy, sell, and trade Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) using cryptocurrency.
How does an NFT Marketplace work?	NFT marketplaces allow creators to mint, list, and sell NFTs, while buyers can purchase these NFTs through bids or fixed prices using cryptocurrencies.
What blockchain is used for NFTs?	The most commonly used blockchain for NFTs is Ethereum, though other blockchains like Binance Smart Chain, Solana, and Flow also support NFTs.
How do I create an NFT Marketplace?	To create an NFT marketplace, you need to integrate blockchain technology, smart contracts, and a platform for users to mint, list, and buy NFTs.
What are smart contracts in an NFT Marketplace?	Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code, enabling secure transactions on the marketplace without intermediaries.
What are the key features of an NFT Marketplace?	Key features include a user-friendly interface, wallet integration, NFT listing and minting, secure payment systems, and a bidding or fixed-price option for transactions.
What is a Smart Contract?	A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. It runs on blockchain networks and executes automatically when predefined conditions are met.
Which blockchain platforms support Smart Contracts?	Popular platforms include Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, Polygon, and Hyperledger. Ethereum is the most widely used for smart contract development.
What programming languages are used for Smart Contracts?	Solidity (Ethereum), Rust (Solana), Vyper (Ethereum), and Chaincode (Hyperledger) are commonly used for developing smart contracts.
Are Smart Contracts secure?	Smart contracts are secure when properly written and audited. However, vulnerabilities like reentrancy attacks and overflow bugs can be exploited, so security audits are essential.
How do Smart Contracts execute transactions?	Once deployed on the blockchain, smart contracts execute automatically based on predefined conditions, eliminating the need for intermediaries.
Can Smart Contracts interact with external data?	Yes, through oracles like Chainlink, smart contracts can fetch external data (e.g., weather, stock prices) securely.
